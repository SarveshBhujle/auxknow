## The Problem AuxNow Solves

In today‚Äôs data-driven world, finding precise and contextual answers quickly is essential. However, existing tools often fall short in terms of:

1. **Flexibility**: Limited ability to customize query handling and responses.
2. **Integration Complexity**: Difficulty in embedding Answer Engines into diverse applications.
3. **Scalability**: Challenges in handling large-scale, dynamic query loads.
4. **Accuracy**: Conventional LLMs by themselves are not optimized for Q&A workflows. AuxNow is based on Perplexity's Sonar models which provide accurate, search grounded results.

AuxKnow addresses these pain points with its configurable architecture and robust features.
