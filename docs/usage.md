# Usage

This section provides examples for using AuxKnow.

## Examples

### Basic Mode

The basic mode sends a query to AuxKnow and retrieves a response.

```python
from auxknow import AuxKnow

# Initialize the AuxKnow instance
auxknow = AuxKnow(api_key="your_api_key", openai_api_key="your_openai_api_key")

# Ask a question
response = auxknow.ask("What is the theory of evolution?")

# Print the answer
print("Answer:", response.answer)
print("Citations:", response.citations)
```

### Streaming Mode

The streaming mode allows you to receive responses in real-time as they are generated.

```python
from auxknow import AuxKnow

# Initialize the AuxKnow instance
auxknow = AuxKnow(api_key="your_api_key", openai_api_key="your_openai_api_key")

# Stream a response
for partial_response in auxknow.ask_stream("Explain quantum mechanics."):
    print(partial_response.answer, end="")
```

### Context-Aware Sessions

AuxKnow allows you to create sessions to maintain conversation context.

```python
from auxknow import AuxKnow

# Initialize the AuxKnow instance
auxknow = AuxKnow(api_key="your_api_key", openai_api_key="your_openai_api_key")

# Create a session
session = auxknow.create_session()

# Ask a question within the session
response = session.ask("What are the main principles of relativity?")
print("Answer:", response.answer)

# Continue with contextual queries
response = session.ask("How does it relate to quantum mechanics?")
print("Answer:", response.answer)

# Close the session when done
session.close()
```

### Custom Configuration

You can customize AuxKnow's behavior by setting specific configurations.

```python
from auxknow import AuxKnow

# Initialize the AuxKnow instance
auxknow = AuxKnow(api_key="your_api_key", openai_api_key="your_openai_api_key")

# Define a custom configuration
task_config = {
    "auto_query_restructuring": True,
    "auto_model_routing": True,
    "answer_length_in_paragraphs": 3,
    "lines_per_paragraph": 5,
    "auto_prompt_augment": True,
    "enable_unbiased_reasoning": False
}

# Apply the configuration
auxknow.set_config(task_config)
```
